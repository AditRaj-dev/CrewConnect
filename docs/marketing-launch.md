🚀 **Super excited to announce the Beta launch of Crew Connect!** 

Ever tried to coordinate lunch with a group of friends on campus, only to realize half of them are stuck in the lab? I built **Crew Connect** to solve this exact daily friction.

Crew Connect is an open-source platform that automatically ingests complex university timetables (via a custom DOM parser) and computes Real-Time Availability algorithms to tell you exactly when your "Crew" is *In Class*, *On Break*, or *Free to hang out*.

🛠️ **Engineering Highlights:**
- Constructed a stateless **Node.js/Express** proxy prioritizing security and referential integrity (Hard Cascade Deletes).
- Built a deeply optimized, offline-first **Flutter app** alongside a hyper-realistic, glassmorphic **React/Vite dashboard**.
- Executed strict data validation against schedule overlap errors directly in the cloud.

## 🎙️ Demo GIF Script (60-sec Walkthrough)
1. **[0:00-0:10]**: (Web) User logs in securely, greeted by an expanding, frosted glassmorphism dashboard.
2. **[0:10-0:20]**: (Web) User clicks "Import EMS Timetable." The system silently extracts the schedule and maps it strictly into a unified calendar matrix.
3. **[0:20-0:35]**: (Web) User creates a new "Circle", generates a secure Invite Code, and sends it to friends.
4. **[0:35-0:50]**: (Mobile) Friend inputs the Invite Code on the offline-first Flutter app. The interface instantly populates their status (e.g., "In Class" pulsing red, "Free" glowing green).
5. **[0:50-0:60]**: (Mobile) The user turns off Wi-Fi. The data seamlessly persists, proving offline validation capabilities.

## 🎯 Pitch & Positioning
**Elevator Pitch**: Crew Connect is a secure, cross-platform ecosystem designed for university students to automatically ingest their complex class schedules, form private groups, and passively detect real-time friend availability—all wrapped in an offline-first mobile app and a hyper-realistic glassmorphic web dashboard.

**Recruiter Positioning**: A production-grade MVP validating the ability to architect multi-client applications. It demonstrates expertise in bridging React web logic and Flutter native logic cohesively over a stateless Node.js data layer while enforcing strict data validation and responsive modern design frameworks.

## 🔎 SEO & Metadata
