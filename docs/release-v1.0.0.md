# Crew Connect - Release v1.0.0 (Beta)

🚀 **The inaugural beta release of the Crew Connect Mobile App is here.**

This Release marks the transition from MVP to a usable, cross-platform product designed to effortlessly solve schedule conflicts and student coordination.

## ✨ Feature Summary
- **Unified Auth System**: Seamlessly log in utilizing the identical secure credentials as the web platform.
- **Offline-First Persistence**: View your friends' live statuses (In Class, On Break, Free) directly from cached memory when traversing poor campus Wi-Fi zones.
- **Built-in DOM Extractor**: An integrated webview that handles the same complex EMS timetable parsing logic locally on the device.
- **Glass UI Optimization**: True multi-layered visual depth optimized natively for 60fps on Android.

## ⚠️ Stability Note
This is a Beta release (`app-release.apk`). While core functionality is aggressively validated, the app is actively undergoing structural backend shifts (such as Section-Based Data Normalization) which may cause transient downtime during deployment windows.

## 📦 Deployment Note
Download the attached `.apk` under Assets, and ensure your Android device allows "Install apps from unknown sources".
iOS users: A definitive TestFlight or App Store deployment is slated for the mid-term roadmap.

## 🛑 Known Limitations
- The underlying API currently maps raw schedules per user. This is slated to be normalized via the upcoming Section-Based architecture refactor.
- Deep linking from SMS invites is actively under development.
